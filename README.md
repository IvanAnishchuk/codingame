My solutions for some puzzles on codingame.

I published those just so I could brag about being cool
and for potential clients to check my skills out.

If you're not a potential client but a fellow codingamer,
please do not use my code to get achievements because it
won't make you smarter anyway. But instead read it
inspirations after you tried to solve the puzzle for
yourself and failed at least seven times. And even after
that please don't copy the code or ideas behind it blindly.

You probably never gonna find my solutions here right after the contest.
Because even if I was able to solve the puzzle in time, I usually take
a few weeks to make the code more pretty, and just so everyone could try
to solve it too before googling answers.

I don't care about copywrongs and the code is 100% original so please consider
it being unlicensed into public domain (under the conditions of CC0, Unlicense,
WTFPL, or BOLA â€” whichever you might prefer). But please, please keep my
attribution intact and don't try to do anything bad with these programs.
